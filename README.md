# `typenum-prime`

This is a rust crate that provides a marker trait for compile-time
primality testing for type-level integers from the `typenum`
crate. The test is defined for all unsigned integers, though currently
requires a high compiler recursion level.

## Usage

The crate is published on https://crates.io/ as `typenum-prime`. Add
it to your `Cargo.toml` in the usual way.
